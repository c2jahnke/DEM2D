% Simulate particles in two dimensions using the discrete element method

% Particle demonstration code with different collision solvers

% Default: DEM modell with linear spring dashpot interaction

% For a first start run DEM2Dmain.m

% To change the number of particles or different contact parameters, etc open DEM2Dparam.m

% To simulate the same particle setting (initial condition), set LoadData = true in DEM2Dmain.m 

% Rotations in beta stage: (some bugs pending), to turn it off set par.considerRotations = false

% Frozen particles for linear penalty based DEM

% Merged particles for linear penalty based DEM in beta stage

% Position Based Dynamics in beta stage

% nonsmooth Projected Gauss Jacobi in beta stage

% Hertz Mindlin Deresievicz in beta state
